         <div class="about-text">  
           <p>  <br> Hello my name is Megan, </br>
            
            <br>I have specialised as a full stack developer.</br>

            <br>I decided to switch my professional path from the banking administration into the tech industry, mainly because 
            I have a creative, passionate and curious personality, 
            that is transcended by my impulse to master new skills, explore inovative experiences and discover novel horizons. 
             And it appears that the IT sector is answering to all my expectations.</br>
            
            <br>Thanks to my diversified and international professional background, I excel at learning in a fast pace environment and thrive in a collaborative workplace. 
            As a flight attendant at Etihad Airways, I have experience working in high-intensity workflows, delivering and performing quality work under tight deadlines, with high-pressure settings.
            As an administrative assistant in a bank, I have developed high organizational skills, by structuring and priorizing my tasks and spaces, to increase productivity in any workplaces. 
            And as natural competitor, I do love challenges, I always have to push myself into being a proficient element. </br>
            
            <br>I understand the importance of experimentation within that field, and which roles front and back end technologies play, to deepen and broaden the developer's skillset. 
            In fact, my most recent experimentation examples, include the creation of web applications.</br>
            
             I have created one named: Doggstragram with the integration of the Vue.js framework and Web APIS. 
            My application concept is to like dog pictures and store/save the favourite ones into a special section, with the use of locale storages. 
            I have also created small game web applications, to consolidate my building skills with React and Express frameworks. </br>
            
            <br>Being a software engineer and building impactful projects on the daily basis, by using programming languages like JavaScript and Python, and by incorporating libraries/frameworks as React, 
            Vue.js or Express, is very stimulating and fulfilling, to me. 
            These powerful tools offer endless possibilities to architecture, design and build amazing technical projects on the Web environnement. 
            So it is such a privilege and a huge excitement to be able to follow that career trajectory.</br>

           <p>
            Practicing by creating projects have proven to be very effective to extend my web developer skillset,
             but I also learnt to become a better engineer by taking daily coding challenges, so I can write code better and faster,
             thanks to platforms as Codewars.
